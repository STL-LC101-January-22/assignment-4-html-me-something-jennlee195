                <h3>Struggle Meals</h3>
                <p>My journey into cooking started where I think it does for a lot of people -- college.
                   <br>It was my second year to be exact. I was finally living in an apartment with a full kitchen and no longer had a meal plan
                  that would allow me off to survive off of dining hall chicken tendies. Armed with a functioning burner, a pot and pan, 
               and a very, very limited budget, (I'll forever be amazed at how far I could make an extra 99&cent; on groceries go back then) 
               I was ready to survive on my own. It was during this time I learned to make staples like
            lentil soup, rice, roast chicken, and spaghetti.</p>

                <h3>Something in Between</h3>
                <p>Around the time I had finished learning a the basics, Buzzfeed's Tasty platform absolutely took off.
                  <br>My mother had FoodNetwork, I now had Tasty. Cooking tutorials had never been so consumable (no pun intended) and seeing a
                  steak dinner for two be broken down into a seamlessly edited 2-minute clip with cheery elevator music made me feel like I could
               now cook anything I could find aa video for. At the same time, I had just turned 21 and had begun my career working in bars. My new
            income from tips would be going straight to Schnucks &amp; Aldi.</p>

                <h3>Farm to Table, but Make it #Fancy</h3>
                <p>A few years ago I met my boyfriend who made me think about my cooking in an entirely different way by asking me one question on
                   our first date: Had I ever cooked with wild game?
                  <br>My answer was no, but as a hippie millennial I'd always been a fan of the Farm to Table concept. Having grown up in Hawaii,
                     sustainability is very close to my heart and what better way could I live off the land than harvest my own meat? And now with
                     years of cooking under my belt, how fancy could I dress up wild game? And this is where I am today -- continually finding new
                     and fun ways to use the deer meat we get from hunting every year.

                     <figcaption>Now this was a masterpiece I cooked up for Valentine's Day this year: a venison chop with lobster tail and sauce
                        over a roasted cauliflower mash, with bacon roasted asparagus. This deer was harvested late last fall from my boyfriend's
                        family farm in northern Missouri.</figcaption>
